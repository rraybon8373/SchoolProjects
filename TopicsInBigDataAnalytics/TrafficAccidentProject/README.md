# Traffic Accident Project

This project took a dataset of traffic crashes in the city of Chicago, located at https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if, and performed basic machine learning on it using pySpark and MLLib.

No real file for this project, just a list of commands that I used in pyspark. No real report either, had to make do with the PowerPoint file.

As a bonus that wasn't required for the project, since the dataset came with longitude/latitude values, I plotted them in RStudio and overlayed it with a density graph. The HTML file is the output of the RMD file.
