I always make sure to take some with me wherever I go, whether it be on my morning walks, the drive to the store where I get my groceries, I even take it to work with me! A lot of times I just get a bottle of air and go to sit and enjoy the sunset. Buying from Bottled Air Lakeland (trademark pending) has really elevated my life; I guess you could say I’ve even become a bit of an ‘airhead’, haha. Highly recommend this service, 11/10!"
