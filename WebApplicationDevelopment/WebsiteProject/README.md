# Website Project

This was a project to create and host a website themed around selling bottled air, showing off basic html/css/js skills. We used an AWS server to host the website at the domain name https://bottledairlakeland.com, though the link is now dead. I included our report/presentation here just for fun, but all the source code is there too
