# PHP Project

This was a project to just create some plugin in php that had some sort of function. The function of the plugin is just to change the color of everything into autumn-themed colors. Basically, we found an autumn-color gradient, calculated how bright each color was, then use the plugin to change the color of every element on the site to match the color gradiant based on how bright the original color was.

I'll be honest, not my best work, though I included it in this project directory because this was the first thing I ever uploaded to github.
