# Sentiment Analysis Project

The purpose of this project was to perform sentiment analysis on the Harry Potter book series, dataset courtesy of https://github.com/reisanar/datasets/blob/master/hp.csv. Essentially, all it is is just using tidyverse to do some cool graphs, like wordclouds of most common words, graphs showing sentiment by book using each of bing, afinn, and nrc lexicons, etc. Details are in the report, the html file is the knitted output of the rmd file.
